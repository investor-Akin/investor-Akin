# Hi there, I’m Akin! 👋

I’m a passionate and curious learner with a growing love for web development. What inspires me is seeing ideas come to life through code from form inputs to logic that actually works and remembers things like magic. I enjoy breaking things down, step by step, until they make total sense. My goal is to become a skilled, confident developer who can build functional, smart, and clean web applications and explain every single line like a teacher.
